# ash-sample-progression
A set of Rust+Ash tutorials meant to mimic the the progression-based tutorials provided by [LunarG Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.0.26.0/linux/tutorial.html).

Our goal is to produce a program that displays a cube, just as in the LunarG tutorial series, except using Rust, and a lightweight Vulkan wrapper [Ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash).
